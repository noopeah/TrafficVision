# TrafficVision
git strategy:
1) things that are *in progress of development* are to be committed and pushed into the deDICKated feature branch. After a feature is done and merged, the feature branch is to be deleted.
2) feature branches *must* have a continious PR for reviews.
3) *never* push and force push to master.
